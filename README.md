This is the final release of the graph-based multi-omis integration solution for GEMMA project.
The release is based on Neo4J Community Edition. In order to replicate the experiment a Reactome Graphdb is needed.

https://reactome.org/dev/graph-database#GetStarted

A working Docker environment is required in order to download and execute Neo4J version of Reactome.

This repository contains a sample of GEMMA Project's data, sufficient to create nodes and edges and link them to relevant Reactome entities. 
Full dataset will be made available after GEMMA participating partners will complete and review their publications.

The repo contains commands to perform all data loading and linking activities. 
An intermediate level of knowledge of graph databases is required. An advanced knowledge of Neo4J as well as its proprietary language Cypher is required to perform operations described in this repository and create a working Reactome environment enriched with GEMMA data. 

GEMMA is a project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 825033. Please see http://www.gemma-project.eu for more information
